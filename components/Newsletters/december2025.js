    <h3>CASE LAW</h3>
<h4>Valuation of Unquoted Equity Shares – DCF Method</h4>
<ul>
<li>The assessee, a private limited company, filed its income tax return for AY 2015–16. It had issued equity shares at face value along with a share premium. The value of the shares was determined using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) method, supported by a valuation report from a qualified accountant. The case was selected for scrutiny, and the Assessing Officer (AO) completed the assessment under Section 143(3), accepting the returned income.</li>
<li>Later, the Principal Commissioner invoked Section 263, stating that the assessment was erroneous and prejudicial to the interests of the Revenue, and directed the AO to pass a fresh assessment order.</li>
<li>In the consequential assessment under Section 143(3) read with Section 263, the AO rejected the DCF valuation. The AO held that the DCF method was based on actual future performance rather than reasonable projections available on the valuation date and claimed that the NAV method was more appropriate.</li>
<li>The assessee appealed before the Tribunal. The Tribunal held that:</li>
<li>The assessee had rightly chosen the DCF method, which is a prescribed and accepted valuation method.</li>
<li>The choice of valuation method cannot be questioned by the AO once it is permitted under law.</li>
<li>The AO was wrong in comparing DCF projections with actual future revenues and profits.</li>
<li>Accordingly, the Tribunal held that the AO had wrongly rejected the DCF method. The order of the Commissioner (Appeals) / NFAC was upheld, and the addition made under Section 56(2)(viib) was deleted.
</ul>

<h4>International Transaction & Transfer Pricing – Software & ITeS (Private Ltd. Co.)</h4>
<ul>
<li> The assessee, a private limited company, provided software development and ITeS services to its Associated Enterprise (AE) and applied the Transactional Net Margin Method (TNMM) for transfer pricing, claiming arm’s length pricing. </li>
<li> The TPO rejected the assessee’s TP study, conducted fresh benchmarking, and determined higher ALPs for both segments. Receivables outstanding beyond 30 days were treated as loans, and notional interest at 13.62% (SBI PLR) was imputed.</li>
<li> The DRP deleted the TP adjustments for software and ITeS services but directed interest on outstanding receivables at LIBOR plus 350 bps, citing LIBOR as a standard benchmark for cross-border financing. The assessee contested the upward ALP adjustments, the classification of receivables as loans, and the notional interest, arguing that the granted credit period was reasonable and already reflected in operating margins.</li>
<li> The Tribunal held that LIBOR was an inappropriate benchmark, and the DRP’s rate was ad hoc. </li>
<li> It observed that outstanding receivables constitute short-term inter-company financing, and interest should reflect invoice currency and associated risk. </li>
<li> The matter was remanded to the AO to benchmark receivables based on invoice currency and examine working capital adjustments for the software and ITeS segments.
</ul>

<h2>GST UPDATE</h2>

<h4>Gujarat AAR – IGST paid basis pre-notice consultation letter not eligible for ITC</h4>

<p>The Gujarat Authority for Advance Ruling in Hansaben Jayantibhai Patel addressed whether ITC could be availed on differential IGST paid pursuant to pre-notice consultation letter issued under Section 28(1) of Customs Act, 1962.</p>

<p>The AAR held that neither the pre-consultation letter nor the duty paying document (challan) are prescribed documents under Section 16(2) of CGST Act and Rule 36(1) of CGST Rules for availing ITC. The Authority applied the ejusdem generis principle of interpretation to the term &#39;similar document&#39; mentioned in Rule 36(1)(d), holding that it must be of the same genus as the preceding words "Bill of Entry", which would include customs declarations and forms but not pre-consultation letters. </p>

<p>The AAR further clarified that challans are also not prescribed documents for availing ITC, citing Board Circular No. 16/2023-Customs which explicitly clarified this position under GST law. Since the fundamental eligibility for ITC was denied, the AAR held that the question of applicability of time limit prescribed under Section 16(4) did not arise and was consequently not answered.</p>

<h4>Gauhati High Court - Section 16(2)(aa) read down to protect bona fide purchasers</h4>

<p>The Gauhati High Court in M/s McLeod Russel India Limited addressed the constitutional validity of Section 16(2)(aa) of CGST Act, which makes ITC availability to recipients contingent on suppliers furnishing invoice details in GSTR-1 returns. The petitioner challenged this provision as arbitrary and unconstitutional, arguing it restricts vested rights of bona fide recipients due to supplier defaults beyond their control.</p>

<p>The Court recognized that Section 16(2)(aa) places onerous burden on purchasing dealers as ITC availability depends on factors controlled by suppliers, not purchasers. The provision imposes impossible burden on purchasers to verify supplier&#39;s GSTR-1 details and auto-population in their GSTR-2A/2B, while GST laws currently provide no mechanism for purchasers to address supplier non-disclosure despite correct tax payment in GSTR-3B. Making ITC denial contingent on invoice reflection in GSTR-2A/2B was held arbitrary.</p> 

<p>The Court held that denying ITC to purchasing dealers for supplier defaults amounts to shifting tax incidence from supplier to buyer, which is unconstitutional and contrary to GST Act&#39;s objective of avoiding cascading taxation and charging only on value additions. However, recognizing the provision&#39;s objective to prevent fraudulent ITC claims and promote supplier compliance, the Court refrained from declaring the amendment unconstitutional.</p>

<p>Instead, Section 16(2)(aa) was read down to require authorities to provide bona fide purchasers opportunity to prove their bona fides through tax invoices and other documents before denying ITC benefits when suppliers act truant. This reading down applies until CBIC develops practical solutions addressing the issue of ITC availability to bona fide purchasers being contingent on supplier-controlled factors.</p>

<h4>Gujarat AAR - introductory offer bundling constitutes mixed supply</h4>

<p>The Gujarat Authority for Advance Ruling in M/s Jivraj Tea International Pvt Ltd addressed the classification of supplies where the applicant planned to provide sachets of instant Premix Tea as introductory offer along with various tea products. The issue was whether such bundled supplies constitute "Composite Supply" under Section 2(30) or "Mixed Supply" under Section 2(90) of CGST Act, 2017. </p>

<p>The AAR held that bundling of premix tea with other tea products does not constitute composite supply as it does not align with consumer perception, since customers do not expect such bunching when purchasing tea. The premix tea is not an ancillary commodity required to be supplied with other tea, nor is it normally advertised as a package with other tea products. The bundling was merely a market testing strategy rather than natural product bundling.</p>

<p>The Authority emphasized that premix tea is not integral to the overall supply such that removing it would affect the nature of supply. Various indicators for ascertaining whether supplies are naturally bundled - including consumer perception, industry practice, and nature of supplies - were absent in this case. Therefore, the supply constitutes "Mixed Supply" rather than "Composite Supply" as premix tea and other tea products are not naturally bundled and supplied in conjunction in the ordinary course of business. 
Since the GST rate on all tea products including premix tea is 5%, the AAR clarified that the rate of tax for the "Mixed Supply" would also be 5%, and any HSN code of the supplies in the mixed supply can be used as long as tax rates remain the same.
</p>

<h4>High Court of Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh - cross-LoC trade constitutes intra-State supply</h4>

<p>The High Court of Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh in M/s New Gee Enn & Sons addressed whether trade between India and Pakistan Occupied Kashmir (PoK) across the Line of Control constitutes zero-rated supply or intra-State sale under GST law. The cross-LoC trade was regulated by a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) issued by the Government of India, which provided for barter trade between divided parts of the State of Jammu and Kashmir without any exchange of currency. The petitioners treated the cross-LoC trade as a zero-rated supply attracting no GST and did not indicate these transactions in their returns or pay any GST on their outward supplies. The Revenue took the view that supplies to and from PoK pursuant to cross-LoC trade conducted as per SOP 2008 are intra-State and taxable under GST. The issue was whether the cross-LoC trade regulated by the SOP is an intra-State trade and therefore amenable to the provisions of the GST Act.</p>

<p>The Court examined the provisions of Section 2(64) of the CGST Act of 2017 and Section 8 of the IGST Act, 2017, which provide that where the location of supplier and the place of supply of goods are in the same State or same Union Territory, that shall be treated as intra-State supply. The Court noted that it was not disputed by the counsels appearing on either side that the area of the State presently under de-facto control of Pakistan is part of the territories of the State of Jammu & Kashmir from a legal and constitutional perspective.</p>

<p>The Court held that in the instant case, the location of the suppliers and the place of supply of goods were within the then State of Jammu Kashmir, which is now a Union Territory. Therefore, applying the statutory definition of intra-State supply, the cross-LoC trade affected by the petitioners during the tax period in question was nothing but an intra-State trade and therefore liable to GST. </p>

<h4>Bombay High Court - SEZ Units entitled to ITC refund following Gujarat HC precedent</h4>

<p>The Bombay High Court in M/s Lupin Limited, Nagpur addressed whether SEZ units can claim refund of unutilized Input Tax Credit under GST law. The respondent authorities had rejected refund applications on grounds that only suppliers of goods or services can file refund claims, not recipient-SEZ units.</p>

<p>The Court held that the Gujarat High Court&#39;s decision in Britannia Industries Ltd v. Union of India, which recognized SEZ units&#39; entitlement to claim refund of unutilized ITC is binding on authorities until a contrary decision is given by another High Court. The Supreme Court had disposed of a challenge to the Gujarat High Court decision keeping the question of law open.</p>

<p>The petition was partly allowed, providing relief to the SEZ unit while ensuring proper verification of authorized operations compliance.</p>

<h4>Gujarat High Court - CA Certificate sufficient for ITC refund, FIRC not mandatory</h4>

<p>The Gujarat High Court in M/s Kuehne Plus Nagel Private Limited addressed refund of unutilized Input Tax Credit where the petitioner had RBI permission to operate on gearing account basis with worldwide offices, allowing foreign currency receipt on exports after making payments in foreign currency. The authorities rejected refund applications for non-submission of Foreign Inward Remittance Certificate as required by Circular No. 125/44/2019.</p>

<p>The Court held that Chartered Accountant&#39;s Certificate submitted by the petitioner should be considered as authentic document, and authorities cannot reject refund claims solely for non-submission of FIRC. In this case, the CA Certificate clearly showed that petitioner received convertible foreign exchange for export of services, making rejection unjustified based solely on FIRC non-submission requirement from the circular. </p>

<p>The impugned orders rejecting refund claims were set aside and respondent authorities were directed to process refund claims in accordance with law, without insisting on FIRC submission and accepting the Chartered Accountant&#39;s Certificate.</p> 

<h4>Delhi High Court - omission of Rule 96(10) applies to pending proceedings</h4>

<p>The Delhi High Court in M/s Vinayak International Housewares Pvt Ltd addressed whether the omission of Rule 96(10) of CGST Rules, 2017 w.e.f. October 8, 2024 would apply to pending proceedings. The petitioners were issued summons and show-cause notices under Rule 96(10), and during the pendency of the petitions, Rule 96(10) was omitted from the CGST Rules. The issue was whether this omission would apply to the pending proceedings against the petitioners, including the summons, show-cause notices, and orders already passed.</p>

<p>The Court held that the 54th GST Council meeting had recommended the omission of Rule 96(10) as it was leading to unnecessary complications without any intended benefit being served. The omission of Rule 96(10) without any saving clause would apply to all pending proceedings, including the summons, show-cause notices, and orders that had not attained finality. The Court emphasized that unless the transactions were "past and closed," the benefit of the omission of Rule 96(10) should be extended to the petitioners.</p> 

<p>The Court noted that the absence of a saving clause indicated legislative intent to apply the omission to pending proceedings as well. When a provision is removed without protecting ongoing proceedings, those proceedings cannot continue on the basis of a non-existent rule</p>  

<p>Accordingly, the summons, show-cause notices, and orders issued against the petitioners under Rule 96(10) of the CGST Rules were quashed.</p>

<h4>Gujarat High Court - software consultancy to parent company is not “intermediary” services</h4>

<p>The Gujarat High Court in M/s Infodesk India Pvt Limited addressed the classification of services provided by the petitioner to its parent company under a service agreement. The petitioner provides software consultancy services to its parent company and filed a refund application for input tax credit availed on inputs and input services used in providing such services, claiming it as &#39;export of service&#39; under Section 2(6) of the IGST Act, 2017. The refund application was rejected on the ground that the services provided were in the nature of &#39;intermediary services&#39; under Section 2(13) of the IGST Act and not &#39;export of services&#39;. The issue was whether the services should be considered as &#39;export of services&#39; or &#39;intermediary services&#39;.</p>

<p>The Court held that the service agreement between the petitioner and its parent company clearly shows that the petitioner is providing software consultancy services on its own account and not as an agent, broker or any other person facilitating the supply of services between two or more persons. The Court emphasized that the petitioner is earning a profit on the cost incurred in providing the services, which demonstrates that it is supplying the services on its own account and not merely as an intermediary. An intermediary typically facilitates transactions between parties without bearing the risk or earning profit margins on the underlying services. Further, the service agreement provides for settlement of disputes between the petitioner and its parent company through arbitration, which further indicates that the petitioner is providing the services independently as a principal rather than as an intermediary.</p>

<p>Accordingly, the Court held that the services provided by the petitioner to its parent company should be considered as &#39;export of services&#39; under Section 2(6) of the IGST Act and not &#39;intermediary services&#39; under Section 2(13).</p>

<h2>GSTN Advisory</h2>

<h3>GSTN Advisory on electronic credit reversal and re-claimed statement and RCM ledger validations (29.12.2025)</h3>

<p>GSTN has issued an advisory on stricter validations for Electronic Credit Reversal and Re-claimed Statement (Reclaim Ledger) and RCM Liability/ITC Statement (RCM Ledger), both introduced to ensure accurate ITC reporting and prevent clerical errors. </p> 
 
<h5>Background:</h5> 

<p>The Reclaim Ledger captures ITC temporarily reversed in Table 4(B)(2) of Form GSTR 3B and subsequent reclaims in Tables 4(A)(5) and 4(D)(1) from August 2023 for monthly taxpayers and July-September 2023 quarter for quarterly taxpayers.</p>

<p>Currently, taxpayers receive warning messages for excess ITC reclaims in Table 4D(1) exceeding available balance in Reclaim Ledger but can still file Form GSTR-3B. Similarly, the RCM Ledger introduced from August 2024 tracks RCM liability shown in Table 3.1(d) and corresponding ITC claimed in Tables 4A(2) and 4A(3), with warnings when claimed ITC exceeds closing balance plus current period liabilities. Taxpayers have been given multiple opportunities to report opening balances for both ledgers covering prior period transactions. </p>

<h5>New validation checks: </h5>

<p>GSTN announces that shortly, negative values or excess ITC availment beyond available balances will not be permitted in either ledger. New validations will enforce that reclaimed ITC in Table 4(D)(1) cannot exceed the combined closing balance of Reclaim Ledger plus current period reversals in Table 4(B)(2). Similarly, RCM ITC claimed in Tables 4(A)(2) and 4(A)(3) must not exceed combined RCM liabilities paid in Table 3.1(d) plus closing balance of RCM Ledger.</p> 

<p>For taxpayers with existing negative closing balances, GSTR-3B filing will be blocked until corrective action is taken. For negative Reclaim Ledger balances, mandatory reversal of excess claimed ITC must be made in Table 4(B)(2), which will be added to current period liability if insufficient ITC is available. For negative RCM Ledger balances, taxpayers must either pay additional RCM liability equivalent to negative closing balance in Table 3.1(d) or reduce ITC claimed in Tables 4A(2) or 4A(3) to match closing balance.</p>

<h3>Sales Tax</h3>

<h4>Bombay High Court - sale of trademark to foreign company constitutes export</h4>

<p>The Bombay High Court in M/s Duphar Interfran Ltd addressed whether the sale of a trademark constitutes a local sale within the State or a sale in the course of export. The applicant company owned the trademark &#39;Crocin&#39; registered in India and sold this trademark to a UK-based company, SKB, through a Brand Acquisition Agreement. The Commissioner of Sales Tax held that the assignment of the trademark was a local sale in Maharashtra liable to 4% sales tax under the Central Sales Tax Act, 1956. The issue was whether the sale of the trademark &#39;Crocin&#39; was a sale within the State of Maharashtra liable to sales tax or a sale in the course of export out of the territory of India not liable to tax.</p> 

<p>The Court relied on the principle of "mobilia sequuntur personam" which means movables follow the owner. Applying this principle to intangible assets, the Court held that the situs of an intangible asset like a trademark follows the situs of its owner. The Court referred to the decision in Mahyco Monsanto v. Union of India, which established that the location of intangible property is determined by the location of its owner rather than any physical registration or documentation.</p> 

<p>The Court emphasized that since the assignee SKB was based in the UK, the situs of the trademark moved to the UK upon assignment, making it a sale in the course of export under Section 5(1) of the Central Sales Tax Act. The Court rejected the argument that the place of registration of the trademark determines its situs, clarifying that registration is not the sole determinant of location for intangible assets. The assignment itself transfers the ownership rights, and with that transfer, the legal situs of the trademark shifts to follow its new owner. </p>

<p>Accordingly, the Court held that the sale of the intangible trademark &#39;Crocin&#39; through the Brand Acquisition Agreement was a sale in the course of export outside India under Section 5 of the Central Sales Tax Act, and not a sale within the State of Maharashtra under Section 4.</p>

<h2>Service Tax</h2>  

<h4>Chandigarh Tribunal - revenue sharing arrangements not taxable as Business Support Services</h4>

<p>The Chandigarh Tribunal in M/s NC Jindal Institute of Medical Care & Research addressed whether revenue sharing arrangements between a hospital and diagnostic service providers (DSPs) constitute taxable Business Support Services.  </p>

<p>The appellants had entered into agreements with DSPs for providing pathology lab and other diagnostic services in the hospital. As per the agreements, the appellants provided basic amenities such as space, water, electricity and other facilities to DSPs for functioning, and the DSPs installed and operated their equipment in the appellant&#39;s premises. The DSPs rendered services to patients both within hospital premises and outside hospital premises.</p>

<p>The Tribunal noted that the appellants raised invoices on patients for diagnostic services rendered in the hospital and shared the receipts with DSPs in an agreed percentage. This was essentially a revenue sharing arrangement rather than a service provider-client relationship. The Tribunal observed that the issue relating to revenue sharing arrangements between the appellants and DSPs was no longer res integra, meaning it was a settled question of law. The Tribunal as well as the departmental Appellate Authority had decided the issue in favour of the appellants for earlier and subsequent periods by consistently holding that revenue sharing arrangements are not subject to service tax under Business Support Services.</p>

<p>Accordingly, the Tribunal held that the revenue sharing arrangements between the hospital and diagnostic service providers did not constitute taxable Business Support Services. The appeals were allowed in favor of the appellants.</p>

<h4>Tribunal - cost sharing among group companies not taxable as Business Support Services</h4>

<p>The Chandigarh Tribunal in case of M/s Boston Scientific India Pvt Ltd addressed whether cost sharing arrangements among group companies constitute taxable Business Support Services under service tax law. The appellant reimbursed expenses to its foreign group company for their share of expenses for events and conferences held outside India. The department issued a demand for service tax under Business Support Services on these reimbursements, treating them as consideration for services rendered.</p>

<p>The Tribunal held that the appellant had reimbursed expenses to its group company abroad for their share of expenses for various events held outside India on a cost-to-cost basis. In such arrangements, the expenses are shared for the common benefit of all entities and no service has been provided by one entity to another entity. The Tribunal emphasized that there is no provision of service at all in this arrangement, as cost sharing is fundamentally different from service provision. When expenses are merely divided among related entities based on their proportionate benefit or usage, it does not result in a taxable service transaction.</p> 

<p>The Tribunal also noted that the entire exercise was revenue neutral because even if the appellant were liable to pay service tax, it would be entitled to avail cenvat credit of the service tax paid and could utilize the same for paying service tax on the taxable output services provided by the appellant. Additionally, since the demand was proposed on the basis of an audit, the extended period of limitation could not be invoked as the department had all the facts in its knowledge.</p> 

<p>Accordingly, the Tribunal held that the sharing of expenses between group companies does not result in provision of any service and hence no service tax is payable.</p>

<h2>Customs</h2>

<h4>Kolkata Tribunal - face recognition access controllers classifiable as automatic data processing machines</h4>

<p>The Kolkata Tribunal in M/s Face IT Systems LLP addressed the classification of imported "Access Controller Face Recognition System" under the Customs Tariff. The issue was whether the imported goods are properly classifiable under CTH 8471 as "Automatic Data Processing Machines" with NIL duty or under CTH 8543 as "Electrical Machines and Apparatus" with 7.5% basic customs duty.</p>

<p>The Tribunal examined the nature and functionality of the imported goods in light of the relevant tariff provisions. The Tribunal noted that the imported goods possessed the essential functions of storing, processing, and executing programs without human intervention. These characteristics are fundamental requirements under Chapter Note 6(A) to Chapter 84 of the Customs Tariff for goods to be classified as Automatic Data Processing Machines. The face recognition access controller systems imported by the appellant could store facial data, process that information through recognition algorithms, and execute access control decisions automatically based on the programmed parameters. </p>

<p>The Tribunal rejected the revenue&#39;s contention that the goods are classifiable under CTH 8543 as "Electrical Machines and Apparatus".</p>

<p>Accordingly, the Tribunal held that the imported goods are properly classifiable under CTH 8471 as "Automatic Data Processing Machines" and are entitled to the NIL duty benefit claimed by the appellant. The impugned order reclassifying the goods and imposing differential duty, interest, and penalties was set aside, and the appeal was allowed in favor of the appellant.</p>

<h3>Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority ACRA issues Financial Reporting Practice Guidance No.1 of 2025 on areas of review focus for FY2025 financial statements</h3>

<p>On 12th November 2025, the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority issued Financial Reporting Practice Guidance No.1 of 2025 on areas of review focus for FY2025 financial statements. This practice guidance serves as a guide for directors, particularly those who serve on audit committees in fulfilling their duties as directors.

<h3>Monetary Authority of Singapore</h3>

<h4>MAS Guidelines for Artificial Intelligence (AI) Risk Management</h4>

<p>The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) has released a consultation paper outlining proposed Guidelines on AI Risk Management aimed at guiding financial institutions (FIs) on the responsible use of artificial intelligence in the financial sector.</p>

<p>The Guidelines will apply to all FIs, detailing MAS’s supervisory expectations regarding AI risk oversight, management systems, policies, lifecycle controls, and the necessary capabilities for AI deployment. Recognising the diverse applications and varying risk profiles associated with AI use, the Guidelines are designed to be broadly applicable yet proportionate to the size, nature, and AI usage of each institution. They cover a wide range of AI technologies, including Generative AI and emerging AI agents.</p>

<h5>Key areas addressed include:</h5>
<ul>
<li>Governance and oversight by boards and senior management to establish risk management frameworks and foster an appropriate risk culture.</li>
<li>Clear identification and inventory of AI applications within firms, alongside risk materiality assessments considering impact, complexity, and reliance.</li>
<li>Lifecycle controls focusing on data management, fairness, transparency, human oversight, third-party risks, evaluation, monitoring, and change management, applied proportionately to risk levels.</li>
<li>Ensuring adequate organisational capabilities and capacity to support AI use.</li>
</ul>

<p>These Guidelines build on MAS&#39;s 2024 thematic review of AI use in key banks and consultations with industry players. MAS has invited public feedback on the proposals by 31st January 2026.</p>

<p>The initiative aims to enable financial institutions to innovate responsibly while managing AI-related risks effectively.</p>

<h3>MAS Proposes to Consolidate Listing Review Functions under SGX RegCo to Streamline the Listing Process</h3>

<p>The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) is consulting on a proposal to consolidate all listing suitability and prospectus review functions under the Singapore Exchange Regulation (SGX RegCo) to streamline the listing process and reduce regulatory overlap for prospective issuers.</p>

<h5>Key Details of the Proposal</h5>
<ul>
<li> Single Point of Engagement: Currently, companies seeking a Mainboard listing must engage with both MAS (for prospectus review) and SGX RegCo (for listing suitability review). The proposal will create a single point of regulatory engagement with SGX RegCo as the sole reviewer.</li>
<li> Delegation of Authority: MAS plans to delegate its powers and duties related to prospectus lodgement and registration under the Securities and Futures Act (SFA) to SGX RegCo.</li>
<li> MAS Oversight: MAS will remain the statutory regulator and retain an overarching supervisory role, including the power to take enforcement actions for SFA breaches and determine regulatory requirements and exemptions for prospectus disclosures.</li>
<li> Removal of Listings Advisory Committee (LAC): The proposal also includes the recommendation to remove the LAC process for Mainboard listings, which was previously a separate layer of review.</li>
<li> Implementation: This move is part of broader measures recommended by the Equities Market Review Group to enhance the competitiveness of Singapore&#39;s equities market. SGX RegCo has already implemented several related rule changes (effective October 29, 2025) and is seeking feedback on further rule amendments to operationalize this consolidation.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Expected Benefits</h4>
<ul>
<li>Enhanced Attractiveness: By streamlining the regulatory process and reducing friction, Singapore aims to enhance its attractiveness as a listing venue and a capital markets hub.</li>
<li>Disclosure-Based Regime: The changes align Singapore with other major developed markets by advancing a more disclosure-based regulatory regime, focusing on issuers providing material information to investors rather than a prescriptive, merit-based approach.</li>
</ul>

<h2>IS AUDIT UPDATES</h2>

<h3>Stay Safe from OneDrive's Latest Security Threat</h3>

<p>A serious vulnerability has been discovered in Microsoft OneDrive that allows malicious websites to access your entire file system without your permission. Once triggered, attackers can browse, download, or even manipulate your cloud files—all without needing your password. Because OneDrive is deeply integrated with Microsoft 365 and Windows, this flaw has wide-reaching implications for both individual and enterprise users. The attack is typically launched through deceptive links, making awareness and caution essential.</p>

<p>The flaw stems from how OneDrive handles link sharing and session tokens. Attackers use social engineering—tricking users into clicking fake login or sharing links. These links exploit OneDrive’s web-based authentication, giving websites access to your files without triggering any obvious warnings. Importantly, this doesn’t require the attacker to know your credentials. Instead, it hijacks trust by using browser sessions and token-based access to gain control. In an organizational setting, the threat is even greater: one compromised account can expose shared folders, internal files, or sensitive client data.</p>

<p>To stay protected, be cautious with links by avoiding unexpected or suspicious ones, especially those that claim to share OneDrive files. Always verify the source before opening any link. Regularly review and revoke access for unfamiliar or unused apps and services connected to your Microsoft account. Enabling Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) adds an extra layer of security, making it much harder for attackers to access your account even if session tokens are compromised. It’s also important to audit your shared files—review documents and folders, removing unnecessary sharing links or restricting access to specific people instead of “anyone with the link.” Keep your browser secure by using the latest versions and avoiding untrusted extensions or scripts that could expose your data. Lastly, educate your team to ensure everyone understands the risks and follows safe practices to prevent accidental exposure.</p>
