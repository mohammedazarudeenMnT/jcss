    <h2>GST UPDATE</h2>
    <h3>Gujarat Appellate AAR – ITC ineligible on Share Buyback ExpensesInput Tax Credit on Financial/Commercial Credit Notes</h3></>

    <p>The Gujarat Appellate Authority for Advance Ruling in M/s Gujarat Narmada Valley Fertilizers & Chemicals Ltd upheld the denial of Input Tax Credit on expenditure incurred for buyback of shares. The appellant challenged the original AAR ruling that disallowed ITC on expenses related to share buyback activities.</p>

    <p>The Appellate Authority held that while goods or services must be used in furtherance of business for ITC eligibility, not every activity furthering business qualifies for credit. Section 17(2) of the CGST Act restricts ITC to taxable supplies including zero-rated supplies and categorically denies credit for goods or services used for exempt supplies. Since shares are securities and are neither goods nor services, transactions in securities do not constitute supply under GST and are not taxable.</p>

    <p>The ruling emphasized that Section 17(2) restricts ITC allowance to expenses attributable to taxable supplies. Tax paid on goods or services used for security transactions, which are not even supplies under GST, cannot be claimed as input tax credit. The argument that buyback activities further business objectives was held irrelevant, as the law specifically excludes transactions in securities from ITC eligibility.</p>

    <p>Regarding reversal of ITC on common inputs and input services, the Appellate Authority ruled that Section 17(3) includes "value of transaction in securities" within the definition of exempt supply, thereby mandating reversal of ITC attributable to such transactions. The appellant was required to reverse ITC on common inputs and input services used for share buyback expenditure. The appeal was dismissed on both counts.</p>

    <h3>Gujarat Appellate AAR – Redemption of Mutual Funds ‘exempt supply’, ITC restricted</h3>

    <p>The Gujarat Appellate Authority for Advance Ruling in M/s Zydus Lifesciences Ltd upheld the original AAR ruling on ITC eligibility for expenses related to mutual fund subscription and redemption. The appellant in this case sought clarity on ITC eligibility on common inputs and input services used towards redemption of mutual fund investments.</p>

    <p>The Appellate Authority rejected the argument that mutual fund redemption differs from sale of securities, holding that under the common parlance test, redemption constitutes sale of mutual fund units back to the Asset Management Company. A conjoint reading of Section 17(3) and the explanation to CGST Rules reveals that mutual fund transactions must be treated as exempt supplies for ITC reversal calculations.</p>

    <h3>Gujarat AAR - ITC on Import of goods when payment to Foreign Supplier is delayed</h3>

    <p>The Gujarat Authority for Advance Ruling in M/s Priya Holdings Pvt Limited ruled on the applicability of the second proviso to Section 16(2) of CGST Act concerning ITC on imported goods where payment to foreign suppliers is deferred beyond 180 days.</p>

    <p>The AAR held that ITC of IGST paid on imported goods remains admissible even when payment to foreign suppliers is deferred beyond 180 days, provided such payment falls within time limits permitted under FEMA and RBI guidelines. The ruling clarified that the second proviso to Section 16(2), which requires payment within 180 days for ITC eligibility, does not apply to import of goods where IGST has already been discharged at the time of import.</p>

    <p>The AAR reasoned that the intent behind the second proviso was to prevent tax evasion, which is not applicable in import scenarios as government revenue is already protected through IGST payment at customs clearance stage. Denying ITC on grounds of non-payment to foreign suppliers when IGST already stands paid would amount to treating equals as unequal, which is impermissible under law.</p>

    <h3>Bombay High Court - Effect of Omission of Rules 89(4B) and 96(10) Without Savings Clause</h3>

    <p>The Bombay High Court in a batch of writ petitions ruled on the effect of omission of Rules 89(4B) and 96(10) of CGST Rules, 2017, which had imposed conditions for claiming refund of IGST paid on exports. The impugned rules were omitted through notification dated 8th October 2024 without any savings clause while multiple petitions challenging their constitutional validity were pending before various High Courts</p>

    <p>The Court held that show cause notices and orders issued under the omitted rules could not be enforced as they had not attained finality before the rules were omitted. The Court applied the common law principle that repeal or omission without savings clause obliterates the repealed provision from the statute book. Rules 89(4B) and 96(10) were held to be not purely procedural but impacting substantive rights of parties, and their removal essentially erased these rules from existence as if they had never been enacted.</p>
    
    <p>The Court clarified that omitted rules should be regarded as provisions that never existed, except for transactions past and closed. Since none of the impugned show cause notices or orders had attained finality, they could not be regarded as transactions past and closed and therefore lapsed upon omission of the rules. The Court rejected the revenue&#39;s argument that Section 174(3) of CGST Act or Section 6 of General Clauses Act, 1897 saved pending proceedings.</p>
    
    <p>The Court specifically held that Section 6 of General Clauses Act does not apply as the impugned rules were omitted by notification and not by Central Act or Regulation as required under Section 6, relying on Constitution Bench decisions in Rayala Corporation Pvt Ltd and Kolhapur Cane Sugar Works Ltd. The impugned show cause notices and orders were quashed, and authorities were directed to consider and dispose of petitioners&#39; refund applications within four months.</p>

    <h3>Supreme Court - SEZ unit&#39;s entitlement to ITC refund (question of law kept open)</h3>

    <p>The Supreme Court in Meghmani Organochem Limited dismissed the revenue&#39;s Special Leave Petition challenging a High Court decision that allowed an SEZ Unit to claim refund of unutilised Input Tax Credit. The revenue contended that only the supplier could claim refund of unutilised ITC and not the SEZ Unit itself.</p>

    <p>The High Court had accepted the SEZ Unit&#39;s argument that it was entitled to claim refund of unutilised ITC on the ground that exports were made without payment of tax under Letter of Undertaking. The Supreme Court, considering the peculiar facts and circumstances of the case and the amount ordered to be refunded, declined to interfere with the High Court&#39;s order.</p>

    <p>Importantly, the Supreme Court kept the question of law open, indicating that this decision should not be treated as a binding precedent on the legal issue. This means the issue may be revisited in future cases. The decision provides temporary relief but leaves legal uncertainty on this aspect of SEZ refund claims.</p>

    <h2>Customs litigation update</h2>

    <h3>License Fees Not Includible in Transaction Value of Software CDs - Delhi Tribunal</h3>

    <p>The Delhi Customs Tribunal (CESTAT) in M/s HCL Technologies Ltd & M/s SAP India Pvt Ltd ruled on whether license fees paid for SAP software should be included in the transaction value of imported CDs containing the software under Rule 9(1)(c) of Customs Valuation Rules, 1988. The case involved HCL importing physical CDs from SAP and separately paying license fees to SAP India for software usage rights.</p>

    <p>The Tribunal held that license fees paid by HCL to SAP India cannot be included in the transaction value of imported CDs. The ruling established that license fees are not associated with the import of physical goods, as the primary delivery mode for SAP Software is electronic. The license fees remain payable regardless of whether CDs are obtained physically or not, demonstrating that the fees relate to intangible rights for software use rather than the imported physical media.</p>

    <p>The Tribunal emphasized that the obligation to pay license fees arises subsequently for obtaining the license key required to access full software functionality, making it a post-importation activity rather than a condition of sale for the goods. Since the primary software delivery mode was electronic and license fees remained payable independent of physical CD import, the value of license fees could not be included under Rule 9(1)(c) of the Valuation Rules.</p>

    <h3>Risk-Based Provisional GST Refunds Introduced</h3>

    <p>The CBIC has issued Instruction No. 06/2025–GST implementing the GST Council’s decision to introduce a risk-based provisional refund mechanism. Effective 1st October 2025, under amended Rule 91(2) of the CGST Rules, the proper officer may sanction 90% of refund claims on a provisional basis within seven days for applications categorized as “low-risk” by the system. Those taxpayers whose Aadhaar authentication is not completed shall not be allowed refund on a provisional basis.</p>

    <p>For zero-rated supplies, low-risk refund applications will receive 90% provisional sanction without detailed scrutiny within seven days once Form GST RFD-02 (refund acknowledgment) is issued. However, officers may deny provisional refund on case-by-case basis with written reasons, proceeding instead with detailed examination. Applications not categorized as low-risk undergo full scrutiny before refund sanction.</p>

    <h3>Exemption from filing GST annual return (GSTR-9) for Turnover up to ₹2 Crore</h3>

    <p>The Government has notified that, effective from FY 2024–25 onwards, registered persons having an aggregate turnover up to ₹2 crore in any financial year are exempt from filing the annual return (Form GSTR-9).</p>

    <h3>Invoice-wise TDS Reporting now mandatory in GSTR-7 (TDS return)</h3>

    <p>A key change has been implemented in Form GSTR-7, shifting TDS reporting under GST from a GSTIN-wise to an invoice-wise format. The GST portal has now enabled invoice-level disclosures, and from the return period of September 2025 onwards, all TDS deductors must mandatorily report invoice-wise TDS details in GSTR-7.</p>

    <h3>GST Circular No. 253 - Withdrawal of Circular 212 – credit notes – ITC reversal by recipient - evidence Mechanism</h3>

    <p>The CBIC has withdrawn Circular No. 212/6/2024-GST dated 26th June 2024 through Circular No. 253/10/2025-GST dated 1st October 2025. Consequently, the procedure prescribed in the earlier circular for providing evidence of compliance with conditions under Section 15(3)(b)(ii) of the CGST Act is no longer required. Suppliers are not required to procure CA/CMA certificates or undertakings from recipients to demonstrate that recipients have reversed input tax credit attributable to post-sale discounts offered through tax credit notes.</p>

   <h3>GST Circular No. 212/6/2024-GST dated 26 June 2024 - Post-Sale Discount Evidence Mechanism [WITHDRAWN]</h3> 

   <p>The CBIC had issued Circular No. 212/6/2024-GST dated 26th June 2024 establishing mechanisms for suppliers to demonstrate compliance with Section 15(3)(b)(ii) of the CGST Act regarding post-sale discounts offered through tax credit notes. The provision requires recipients to reverse proportionate input tax credit attributable to such discounts for suppliers to exclude them from taxable value.</p>

   <p>The Board acknowledged that currently no system functionality exists on the common portal for suppliers or tax officers to verify whether recipients have reversed the required input tax credit. Until such portal functionality is developed, suppliers must obtain certificates from recipients as evidence of ITC reversal compliance.</p>

   <p>For discounts where the tax amount involved exceeds Rs 5 lakhs in a financial year, suppliers must procure certificates from Chartered Accountants or Cost Accountants certifying that recipients have reversed the required proportionate input tax credit. These certificates must contain details of credit notes, relevant invoice numbers, ITC reversal amounts, and references to Form GST DRC-03 or returns showing such reversals. All certificates must include Unique Document Identification Numbers verifiable through ICAI or ICMAI websites.</p>

   <p>For discounts involving tax amounts not exceeding Rs 5 lakhs per financial year per recipient, suppliers may obtain undertakings or certificates directly from recipients instead of professional certifications. These certificates and undertakings constitute suitable admissible evidence under Section 15(3)(b)(ii) and must be produced during scrutiny, audit, or investigation proceedings. The mechanism applies retrospectively, allowing suppliers to procure such evidence for past periods where required by tax authorities</p>

   <p>UPDATE: This circular has been withdrawn vide Circular No. 253/10/2025-GST dated 1st October 2025. The procedure prescribed for providing evidence of compliance under Section 15(3)(b)(ii) is no longer required.</p>

   <h2>GST Appellate Tribunal</h2>
    
   <h3>Launch of GST Appellate Tribunal (GSTAT) - 24 September 2025</h3>

   <p>Union Finance Minister Smt. Nirmala Sitharaman launched the Goods and Services Tax Appellate Tribunal on 24th September 2025 in New Delhi, marking a significant milestone in GST dispute resolution. GSTAT is a statutory appellate body established under GST laws to hear appeals against orders passed by GST Appellate Authorities, providing taxpayers with an independent forum for justice.</p>

   <p>The Tribunal will operate through a Principal Bench in New Delhi and 31 State Benches across 45 locations throughout India, ensuring nationwide accessibility. Each Bench comprises two Judicial Members, one Technical Member from Centre, and one Technical Member from State, reflecting balanced composition of judicial expertise and technical knowledge from both administrations in the spirit of cooperative federalism.</p>

   <p>The launch included unveiling of the GSTAT e-Courts Portal, enabling taxpayers and practitioners to file appeals online, track case progress, and participate in hearings through digital mode. </p>

  <a href="https://efiling.gstat.gov.in">Website: https://efiling.gstat.gov.in</a>

   <h3>Timeline for Filing Appeals Before GSTAT:</h3>

   <p>The government has notified 30th June 2026 as the deadline for filing appeals before GSTAT in respect of orders communicated before 1st April 2026. This extended timeline provides taxpayers with sufficient opportunity to file pending appeals that have accumulated since GST implementation.</p>

   <p>For all appeals relating to orders communicated on or after 1st April 2026, the standard limitation period of three months from the date of order communication applies. This transitional arrangement ensures that taxpayers have adequate time to approach the newly constituted Tribunal while maintaining the regular limitation framework for future cases.</p>

   <h3>Staggered Appeal Filing Timelines for Backlog (GSTAT)</h3>

   <p>The Government has introduced a staggered schedule for filing appeals to manage the huge backlog of cases and prevent system overload.<br/>
   The final cut-off date for all these backlog cases remains 30th June , 2026.</p>

   <p>The filing window for your GSTAT appeal depends entirely on when your original First Appeal (APL-01/03) or Revision Notice (RVN-01) was filed/issued on the common portal:</p>
    
   <table>

   </table>

    <p><b>Final Deadline for APL-05:</b> Regardless of the staggered filing window, the last date for filing an appeal to the GSTAT for all backlog cases is 30th June, 2026.</p>

    <h4>Appeals to be Heard Only by Principal Bench of GSTAT</h4>
    <h4>The Government has notified certain cases that will be heard exclusively by the Principal Bench of GSTAT.</h4>

    <dl>
      <p>Cases covered:</p>

      <dt>1. Multiple State Benches, Same Legal Question:</dt>

    </dl>

    <h3>GSTN Advisory: New Features in Invoice Management System (IMS)</h3>
<h4>Pending action for specified records</h4>
<p>GSTN has introduced important changes to the IMS, allowing taxpayers to mark certain records as "pending" for a limited time. For monthly filers, the pending status can be retained for one month; for quarterly filers, for one quarter only.</p>

<dl><dt>The facility applies to specific records, namely:</dt>
<dd>a) Credit Notes or upward amendments of Credit Notes;</dd>
<dd>b) Downward amendments of Credit Notes where the original note was rejected;</dd>
<dd>c) Downward amendments of Invoices or Debit Notes where the original was accepted and Form GSTR-3B has been filed; and</dd>
<dd>d) Downward amendments of e-Commerce Operator (ECO) documents where the original was accepted and GSTR-3B has been filed.</dd>
<p>This change aims to give taxpayers limited flexibility to manage corrections or modifications within the same tax period.</p>
</dl>
<h3>Declaring ITC reduction amount</h3>
<p>GSTN has introduced a new feature in the IMS to enable taxpayers to declare the amount of ITC actually availed and, where applicable, reversed for specified records. It has been clarified that no ITC reversal is required where the credit has not been availed on the concerned invoice or document. In cases of partial ITC availment, reversal is required only to the extent of ITC availed.</p>
<p>The IMS now allows taxpayers to record such reversals—either in full or in part—by entering the actual ITC amount availed and reversed. This functionality can also be used where the ITC was already reversed earlier or not availed at all.</p>
<p>The changes with respect to keeping credit notes pending and declaring the ITC amount, as mentioned above will be operational on the GSTN portal from October tax period.</p>

<h3>Option to Add Remarks in IMS</h3>

<p>GSTN has introduced an optional feature to save remarks while taking ‘Reject’ or ‘Pending’ action on records in the IMS. This enhancement, to be rolled out shortly, will allow taxpayers to record contextual remarks explaining their action. The remarks will be visible in Form GSTR-2B for the recipient’s reference and also to suppliers through the Outward Supplies dashboard, enabling them to take timely corrective action.</p>

<h3>Foreign Trade Policy </h3>
<h4>Update on RoDTEP Scheme</h4>

<p>The RoDTEP (Remission of Duties and Taxes on Exported Products) Scheme has been extended for exports by DTA units, Advance Authorization (AA) holders, Export Oriented Units (EOUs), and Special Economic Zones (SEZ) units up to 31st March 2026.</p>

<p>The RoDTEP Scheme was launched in August 2021 to reimburse embedded duties and taxes on exported goods.</p>

<p>Initially, AA holders, EOUs, and SEZ units were excluded from the scheme when rates were notified effective 1 January 2022. However, subsequently the Government extended RoDTEP benefits to AA holders, EOUs, and SEZ units as well.</p>

<h3>Service Tax</h3>

<h4>Distribution of Software a Deemed Sale of Goods – Hyderabad Tribunal</h4>

<p>The Hyderabad Tribunal (CESTAT) in M/s Zoom Technologies India Pvt Ltd ruled on the classification of software distribution transactions as either sale of goods or provision of service taxable under Information Technology Software Services. The appellant entered into distribution agreements with foreign vendors for distributing anti-virus software in India, paid VAT on software sales, and discharged service tax out of abundant caution while the department contended the transactions fell under ITSS category.</p>

<p>The Tribunal held that the transactions constituted deemed sale of goods and were not liable to service tax. The ruling established that foreign vendors had not transferred the right to use software to the appellant but only granted nonexclusive intellectual property rights to distribute products. The End User License Agreement existed between foreign vendors and end-users, with the appellant merely providing unique activation keys to end-users as an intermediary in the distribution chain.</p>

<p>Based on the distribution agreement terms and following precedents in Sakri IT Solutions Pvt Ltd and Quick Heal Technologies Ltd, the Tribunal concluded the transaction amounted to deemed sale of goods rather than service provision.</p>

<h2>SINGAPORE UPDATES</h2>
<h3>Monetary Authority of Singapore</h3>
<dl>
<dt>MAS Introduces Initiatives to Promote Responsible Online Financial Content, Issues Advisory Letters to Content Creators
On 25th September 2025, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (“MAS”) announced a series of initiatives aimed at fostering responsible digital financial content and advertising. These include:</dt>
<dd>
a) the publication of new Guidelines on Standards of Conduct for Digital Advertising Activities (Guideline No. FSG-03) (the "MAS Guidelines"), effective 25th March 2026;

</dd>
<dd>b) a collaborative guide with the Advertising Standards Authority of Singapore (“ASAS”) titled 7 Must-Knows When Sharing Financial Information Online (the "ASAS Guide").</dd></dl>

<p>Additionally, MAS has issued advisory letters to five online content creators for potentially providing unlicensed financial advice, signalling heightened enforcement scrutiny.</p>

<p>These developments underscore the MAS&#39; focus on mitigating risks arising from the use of digital platforms—particularly social media platforms—such as misleading promotions, deceptive practices, and unauthorized content dissemination.</p>

<p>This bulletin analyses the key learning points from the MAS Guidelines and ASAS Guide and highlights practical next steps which financial institutions (“FIs”), their representatives, and third-party digital marketers (including influencers) should prioritize to ensure compliance.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Key initiatives</dt>
<p>1. Guidelines on Standards of Conduct for Digital Advertising Activities
The Guidelines apply to all financial institutions and their appointed third parties (e.g., finfluencers) who advertise financial products and services to customers via digital media. They will take effect on 25th March 2026.</p>

<p>The Guidelines establish five key safeguards which financial institutions must adopt to manage risks associated with digital advertising, as listed below:</p>

<dd>1. financial institutions should assess and ensure that their choice of digital media is appropriate for advertising financial products and services to customers. Financial institutions will need to consider how to put in place new processes for appropriateness assessments in this regard, which will be challenging;</dd>

<dd>2. financial institutions should assess the characteristics and limitations of digital media, address the associated risks, and ensure that important and meaningful disclosures are presented prominently and clearly. MAS has provided an extensive list of examples of disclosures to be included;</dd>

<dd>3. financial institutions should assess and select appropriate digital marketers, and ensure these digital marketers are adequately apprised and comply with the institutions&#39; digital advertising practices and regulatory requirements; </dd>

<dd>4. financial institutions should monitor digital advertising activities conducted by their digital marketers to ensure effective oversight of these activities;</dd>

<dd>5. financial institutions should take appropriate disciplinary action against digital marketers to deter malpractices and errant conduct related to digital advertising.</dd>

<p>The Guidelines also emphasise that the MAS will hold the Board and Senior Management accountable for ensuring that their financial institution&#39;s digital advertising activities are conducted in accordance with the Guidelines. We can read this as a stern warning to financial institutions on the importance of proactive engagement with the Guidelines by all financial institutions.</p>

<dt>2. Guide on Responsible Financial Content Creation</dt>
<p>To guide content creators on responsible financial content creation, MAS has collaborated with the ASAS to develop the Guide on Responsible Financial Content Creation. This guide provides a list of seven “must-knows” when sharing financial information online – such as when a licence from MAS may be required, steps to take before promoting an entity&#39;s products or services, and the disclosure of compensation received.</p>

<dt>3. Advisory Letters to Content Creators</dt>
<p>In a media release, MAS also announced that it will be issuing advisory letters to five content creators who may have provided financial advice without a licence. They have been advised to adjust their content and practices to be in line with MAS&#39; regulatory requirements. Persons who continue to provide financial advice without a licence will face enforcement action.</p>
