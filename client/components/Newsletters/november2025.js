  <h3>CASE LAW</h3>
  <h3>Customs TR-6 Challan Not Eligible for ITC Claim - Tamil Nadu AAAR</h3>

<p>The Tamil Nadu Appellate Authority for Advance Ruling in M/s Becton Dickinson India Private Limited upheld the original AAR ruling that TR-6 challans cannot be considered as eligible documents for claiming Input Tax Credit on differential IGST paid on imports. The appellant had sought clarity on whether ITC could be availed on IGST paid through TR-6 challans under Section 16(2) of CGST Act read with Rule 36 of CGST Rules, 2017.</p>

<p>The Appellate Authority held that neither TR-6 challan by itself, nor TR-6 challan read with SVB orders and letters issued by tax authorities, qualifies as an eligible document for ITC purposes. The ruling interpreted the phrase "a bill of entry or any similar document" in Rule 36(1)(d) to mean that apart from being similar to a Bill of Entry, the document must also be prescribed under the Customs Act, 1962 or rules made thereunder.</p>

<p>The Authority also ruled that the time limit to claim ITC under Section 16(4) also applies to ITC on re-assessed bills of entry through mutatis mutandis application of CGST Act provisions to IGST Act under Section 20.</p>

<h3>Gujarat AAR - No ITC on Lease Rental for Land Used for Factory Construction</h3>

<p>The Gujarat Authority for Advance Ruling in M/s Agratas Energy Storage Solutions Pvt Ltd addressed ITC eligibility on GST paid on lease rental for land used to construct manufacturing facilities. The applicant had entered into a 50-year lease agreement with Government of Gujarat for land to set up a battery cell manufacturing factory for motor vehicles.</p>

<p>The AAR held that the applicant is not eligible for ITC on GST charged on lease rental where factory buildings would be constructed on leased land. Following precedents in Bayer Vapi Pvt Ltd and GACL-NALCO Alkalies and Chemicals Pvt Ltd, the Authority ruled that leasehold rights to land are services used for construction of immovable property, making ITC blocked under Section 17(5)(d) of CGST Act. The AAR rejected the narrow interpretation of the term&#39;for&#39; in Section 17(5)(d), holding it has wider connotation including all services required for construction, not just those with direct nexus.</p>

<p>On temporal aspects, the AAR clarified that ITC on lease rental remains blocked for periods both prior to and after factory construction. Since land was leased specifically for industrial construction purposes, services related to land are blocked under Section 17(5)(d) irrespective of construction stage. The ruling extended this position to repairs, maintenance, and renovation activities, holding that &#39;construction&#39; in Section 17(5)(d) includes reconstruction, renovation, additions, alterations, or repairs to the extent of capitalization.</p>

<p>The Authority also ruled that ITC remains blocked even for vacant portions of leased land. The Authority reasoned that entire land was leased for industrial purposes, and any portion including vacant areas would be considered as used for construction of immovable property. This comprehensive denial of ITC on land lease rentals applies throughout the lease period regardless of actual construction status or land utilization.</p>

<h3>Reply to SCN Must Be Considered Even After Stipulated Time - Jammu & Kashmir High Court</h3>

<p>The Jammu & Kashmir High Court ruled on the obligation of proper officers to consider replies submitted by assessees in response to show cause notices, even when such replies are submitted after the time period stipulated in the SCN but before passing the final order under Section 73(9) of CGST Act. The case involved an assessee whose reply was not considered because it was submitted after the deadline mentioned in the show cause notice.</p>

<p>The High Court held that if a reply or representation is received by the proper officer before passing the final order under Section 73(9), it becomes incumbent upon the officer to consider such reply and pass a reasoned order. The Court emphasized that the time period for submitting reply to show cause notices is not statutorily prescribed under the CGST Act, making the deadlines mentioned in SCNs merely directory rather than mandatory.</p>

<p>The Court ruled that delay in submission of reply should not deprive the assessee of the fundamental opportunity to be heard, which is a cornerstone of natural justice. Passing final orders without considering replies submitted before the order would constitute a violation of principles of natural justice, rendering such orders legally unsustainable regardless of technical compliance with SCN timelines.</p>

<h3>Bunching of Show Cause Notices for Multiple Years Impermissible - Bombay High Court</h3>

<p>The Bombay High Court in M/s Milroc Good Earth Developers quashed consolidated show cause notices issued by revenue authorities covering multiple financial years from 2017-18 to 2023-24. The petitioners challenged the practice of issuing single SCNs covering several years without separate year-wise adjudication.</p>

<p>The Court held that issuance of consolidated show cause notices covering multiple financial years with composite demands is impermissible under the CGST Act scheme. The Act contemplates assessment and levy of tax based on filing of returns for each tax period, which is either monthly or annual. The provisions for assessment, limitation, and recovery are structured around tax periods, typically financial years, and the term "tax period" is defined as the period for which returns are required to be furnished.</p>

<p>The Court emphasized that Sections 73 and 74 provisions for determining tax liability refer to "financial year" and prescribe separate limitation periods for each financial year. Proper officers must issue separate SCNs for each financial year as limitation periods and statutory safeguards apply independently for each year. Bunching of SCNs for multiple years frustrates the limitation scheme, prevents assessees from providing year-specific rebuttals, and amounts to jurisdictional overreach by authorities.</p>

<p>The Court distinguished the Delhi High Court decision in Ambika Traders case, noting that those facts revolved around wrongfully claimed ITC prescribed for subsequent years, making them distinct from the present case. Additionally, the SLP in Ambika Traders was withdrawn before the Supreme Court, limiting its precedential value. The consolidated show cause notices were quashed and writ petitions allowed.</p>

<h3>Tax Demand Cannot Exceed Amount in Show Cause Notice - Chhattisgarh High Court</h3>

<p>The Chhattisgarh High Court in M/s Golden Cargo Movers set aside final assessment orders that imposed tax demands exceeding the amount specified in the show cause notice.</p>

<p>The Court held that Section 75(7) of CGST Act, 2017 clearly stipulates that the amount of tax, interest, and penalty demanded in final orders shall not exceed the amount specified in show cause notices, and no demand shall be confirmed on grounds other than those specified in the notice. In the present case, the final assessment order imposed demands significantly higher than amounts mentioned in the SCN, directly violating Section 75(7) provisions.</p>


<h2>GST UPDATE</h2>

<h3>Automated GST Registration Approval under Rule 9A (Effective November 2025)</h3>

<p>Effective November 2025, the process of GST registration has been simplified and accelerated following the introduction of Rule 9A. Now, most applicants—such as normal taxpayers, TDS and TCS deductors—can receive automated electronic approval of their GST registration within just three working days. This fast-track approval is driven by GSTN portal based advanced data analytics and risk profiling. However, applications flagged as high-risk may still be subject to officer verification.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Benefits of automated GST registration approval under Rule 9A:</dt>
<dd>Faster Registration: Electronic, system-driven approvals are completed within 3 working days for low-risk applicants, drastically reducing registration time.</dd>
<dd>Reduced Manual Intervention: Applications flagged as “low risk” by analytics are auto approved, eliminating delays and dependency on officer workload. Only high-risk or flagged cases go for manual scrutiny.</dd>
</dl>

<h3>GSTN- Advisory - Introduction of Import of Goods details in IMS</h3>

<p>The GSTN has issued an advisory announcing a major enhancement to the Invoice Management System (IMS) with the introduction of a new "Import of Goods" section effective from the October 2025 tax period. This new functionality allows taxpayers to view and take actions (Accept or Keep Pending) on the Bill of Entry (BoE) details filed for imports, including imports from Special Economic Zones (SEZs), directly within the IMS dashboard.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Key points of the advisory:</dt>
<dd>The "Import of Goods" section in IMS displays original and amended BoE details for imports from overseas and SEZs.</dd>
<dd>Taxpayers can accept or keep pending each BoE; if no action is taken, it is deemed accepted.</dd>
<dd>Based on these actions, the GST portal generates the draft GSTR-2B for the recipient on the 14th of the subsequent month.</dd>
<dd>Actions can be modified even after draft GSTR-2B generation until filing of corresponding GSTR-3B.</dd>
<dd>The system handles GSTIN amendments in BoEs, enabling reversal of ITC for old GSTINs and credit for new GSTINs.</dd>
</dl>


<p>These changes simplify import reconciliation for taxpayers by integrating Customs import data (BoEs) with GST inward supplies in the IMS.</p>

<h3>Foreign Trade Policy</h3>

<h4>‘Export’ Definition Under FTDR Act Governs 100% EOU Exemption Notifications - Hyderabad Tribunal</h4>

The Hyderabad Tribunal in Laxai Avanti Life Sciences Pvt Ltd addressed the interpretation of &#39;export&#39; for exemption eligibility under Customs and Central Excise exemption notifications issued to 100% Export Oriented Units. The appellant, a 100% EOU, had imported capital goods and raw materials availing exemptions under Notification No. 52/2003-Customs and Notification No. 22/2003-Central Excise dated 31.03.2003, conditioned upon exporting goods or services.

The department denied exemption benefits on grounds that the appellant&#39;s services viz. Technical Testing and Analysis services were liable to service tax and did not qualify as “export” under the Export of Service Rules, 2006 under the Finance Act (Service Tax Law). The key issue was whether &#39;export of service&#39; concept under Export of Service Rules could be applied to determine exemption eligibility under Customs and Central Excise notifications, or whether &#39;export&#39; should be construed per the Foreign Trade Development and Regulation Act, 1992.

The Tribunal held that the term &#39;export&#39; in exemption notifications issued under Customs Act and Central Excise Act must be construed in accordance with the FTDR Act definition, not based on Export of Service Rules under Finance Act. The EOU Scheme is governed by Foreign Trade Policy, and FTDR Act provides specific definition of &#39;export&#39; in relation to services, including supplying services from India to any other country&#39;s territory or to service consumers of other countries while in India.

Since appellants received payments in convertible foreign exchange for services provided to recipients located outside India, they were eligible for exemption notification benefits irrespective of Export of Service Rules requirements. The impugned orders were set aside and appeals allowed.

<h4>Royalty payment for technical know-how not includible in assessable value of imported goods - Delhi Tribunal</h4>

<p>The Delhi Tribunal, in the case of M/s Ericsson India Private Limited, considered an issue concerning the inclusion of royalty payments in the assessable value of imported goods for levying Customs duty. The appellant, Ericsson India, imported various IT components from a related foreign entity and simultaneously paid a royalty to the same foreign supplier for know-how related to the manufacture of the final finished goods in India.</p>

<p>The Department contended that this royalty payment was required to be added to the transaction value of the imported components under Rule 10(1)(c) of the Customs Valuation Rules, 2007, essentially arguing it was a condition of sale.</p>

<p>The central point of determination before the Tribunal was whether the royalty paid for the technical know-how used in the post-importation manufacturing of finished goods should be included in the transaction value of the imported components.</p>

<p>The Tribunal ruled that the mere fact of imported components being used in the manufacture of finished goods does not automatically justify the addition of the royalty paid on the finished goods to the value of the imported components. It was held that where the royalty payments relate to activities performed after importation and, are not stipulated as a condition of sale for the imported goods, such payments cannot be included in the imported value under Rule 10(1)(c). The Technical Agreements between Ericsson India and the foreign supplier did not mandate the payment of royalty as a prerequisite (sine qua non) for the import of the components.</p>

<p>Consequently, the Tribunal set aside the impugned order and allowed the appeal, affirming that the royalty amount should be excluded from the Customs valuation of the imported components.</p>

<h2>SINGAPORE UPDATES</h2>

<h3>Monetary Authority of Singapore</h3>

<h4>MAS Launches BLOOM Initiative to Extend Settlement Capabilities</h4>

<p>On 16th October 2025, The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) announced a new initiative – BLOOM (Borderless, Liquid, Open, Online, Multi-currency), to extend settlement capabilities offered by financial institutions. Through BLOOM, MAS will collaborate with the financial industry to enable settlement in tokenised bank liabilities and well-regulated stablecoins, whilst effectively managing risks in the rapidly evolving digital settlement asset landscape, through standardised approaches.</p>

<p>BLOOM will enable settlement in multiple currencies, including G10 and Asian currencies, and support both domestic and cross-border transactions.</p>

<p>Initial applications will focus on wholesale banking use cases such as trade finance, corporate treasury management, and automated “agentic” payments, which use AI to execute transactions based on pre-set conditions.</p>

<p>Participating institutions include DBS, OCBC, UOB, Circle, Partior, Stripe, Ant International, StraitsX, and Coinbase. Together, they will explore three key areas: coordinated clearing of settlement assets, programmable compliance checks to reduce costs and improve consistency, and AI-driven payment automation.</p>

<p>The launch marks a major step in Singapore drive to modernise its financial infrastructure and strengthen its role as a global center for digital finance.</p>

<p>BLOOM also builds on Project Orchid, an MAS-led initiative that began in 2021 to explore the potential of a digital Singapore dollar. Insights from more than 10 trials under Project Orchid have already been translated into commercial solutions by participating institutions.</p>

<h4>MAS Proposes to Consolidate Listing Review Functions under SGX RegCo to Streamline the Listing Process</h4>

<p>The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) is seeking feedback on proposals to consolidate the listing review functions under the Singapore Exchange Regulation (SGX RegCo) with a view to streamline the listing process. This is part of the holistic set of recommendations announced by the Equities Market Review Group to adopt a regulatory approach that is pro-enterprise, alongside measures to strengthen investor confidence.</p>

<p>Companies seeking to list on the Singapore Exchange (SGX) may soon find the process more streamlined.</p>

<p>The consolidation of listing review functions under SGX RegCo will provide prospective issuers with greater certainty on the listing process and timeline. Going forward, they will only have to engage with SGX RegCo. Currently, issuers engage with MAS to review their prospectus, and with SGX RegCo on their suitability to list SGX RegCo will continue to focus on admitting quality issuers and ensuring that issuers disclose relevant and material information to support informed decision-making. MAS will continue to work with SGX RegCo to ensure timely and robust market surveillance and enforcement, as well as investigate and take action against breaches of prospectus disclosure requirements under the Securities and Futures Act.</p>

<h3>Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore</h3>
<h4>GST and BCRS Deposit</h4>

<p>The Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS) has released guidance on the GST rules related to the Beverage Container Return Scheme (BCRS) that will be introduced from April 1st, 2026.</p>

<p>Under the scheme, a 10-cent refundable BCRS deposit will be payable on each regulated beverage sold.</p>

<p>Regulated beverages are pre-packaged beverages in plastic and metal containers ranging from 150 millilitres to three litres. Consumers will receive a full refund of the deposit by returning the empty container to a designated return point.</p>

<p>The BCRS deposit will not be subject to GST. As such, taxpayers need not include the deposit in tax invoices or GST receipts issued for the sale of beverages.</p>

<p>The guidance specifically discusses rules concerning invoicing, credit notes, rules concerning the completion of GST returns, and price display requirements.</p>
